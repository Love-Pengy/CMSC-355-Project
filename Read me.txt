--------------------------------------------------
Updates for sprint 2:

1) Added functionality to edit a customers name after they've been 
   entered

2) Updated DOB validation- program now rejects DOB entries that are 
   logically invalid (ex- 1993-13-32 would be invalid)

3) Searching for customer now returns both name and account number 
   when the customer is found, rather than just customer name
